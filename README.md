## Overview
Balrog is a prokaryotic gene finder based on a Temporal Convolutional Network. Paper link forthcoming...

## Getting started
Click the "Open in Colab" button above to get started. Because Balrog uses a complex gene model and performs alignment-based search with mmseqs2, each genome takes ~10-15 minutes to process. Feel free to open a GitHub issue if you run into problems.
